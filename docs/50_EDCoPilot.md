# EDCoPilot Integration
We are excited to work with Razzafrag on integrating **COVAS:NEXT** with **EDCoPilot**!

**Disclaimer:** EDCoPilot does not share the contents of its UI, nor any other data. You can use it for its UI, but **it adds zero functionality or knowledge to the AI**.

This currently has three benefits:

1) You can see the COVAS:NEXT dialogue in EDCoPilot's "Voice Activity" panel

2) You can prevent both applications from talking over each other

3) You can control EDCoPilot's UI via COVAS:NEXT's tools

## Show dialogue in EDCoPilot
With EDCoPilot installed, COVAS:NEXT will automatically add a new configuration option to enable EDCoPilot.
This option is enabled by default, so it should work without further modification.

## Preventing both applications from talking at the same time
By default, both EDCoPilot and COVAS:NEXT will react to certain events inside your game. 

We provide two different solutions:

1) Let COVAS:NEXT decide what, where and how to comment **(COVAS:NEXT Dominant Mode)**
  
2) Let EDCoPilot decide what, where and how to comment **(EDCoPilot Dominant Mode)**

### 1. COVAS:NEXT Dominant Mode 
This mode lets you talk to COVAS:NEXT as usual, while EDCoPilot's event commentary is muted. This is the default mode and ensures that COVAS:NEXT comments are low-latency and not delayed by EDCoPilot commentary.

In order to mute EDCoPilot game commentary, you should open EDCoPilot Settings -> Ship AI Personality -> Disable "EDCoPilot Dominant"

### 2. EDCoPilot Dominant Mode

This mode also lets you talk to COVAS:NEXT, while EDCoPilot also generates its own commentary. In order to avoid excessive and redundant commentary, you should configure the behaviour of COVAS:NEXT to only respond to those events that EDCoPilot does not already comment on in the Behaviour tab.
   
In order to enable both applications' commentary, you need to enable the `EDCoPilot-Dominant` setting inside of COVAS:NEXT.

This setting will mute COVAS:NEXT's Text-to-Speech and instead sends all text over to EDCoPilot, where it will be read out, but might be delayed by ongoing EDCoPilot commentary and generally higher latency.

## Control EDCoPilot's UI via COVAS:NEXT
By default EDCoPilot's UI actions are disabled. We strongly recommend to only activate one set of UI actions, either COVAS:NEXT's or EDCoPilot's.
